        </h1>
        <p>PMS Unit Type Mapping and Offset Pricing is a feature that allows you to map PMS Unit Types to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Unit Types at any time, instead of only during the initial community setup. You can also enter a corresponding Pricing Offset for each unit type, if necessary. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/pricing_offsets_def.flsnp" /></p>
        <p>Mapping unit types and entering pricing offsets are typically done by an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Business Consultant.</p>
        <h2>How to use PMS Unit Type Mapping and Offset Pricing</h2>
        <h3>New Communities</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI, go to the Configuration tab.</li>
            <li>Set up unit categories  on the Unit Categories screen.</li>
            <li>On the Unit Types screen, verify the unit types are correct. Add or edit the unit types as necessary. Assign a unit category to each unit type.</li>
            <li>On the PMS Unit Types screen, verify the PMS unit types are correctly mapped to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit types. Enter the pricing offset amounts for any unit types, if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Existing Communities </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You can see the PMS unit type mappings using the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI on the Unit Types and PMS Unit Types screens under the Configuration tab. On the PMS Unit Types screen, you can change the mappings if you want to. </p>
            </li>
            <li>You can also enter pricing offsets for PMS Unit Types on the PMS Unit Types screen as well. If you previously accounted for an offset as an amenity, you will need to remove it from the amenities after you add it here. Amenities are set up in the PMS system.</li>
            <li>If you need to set up or change your unit categories or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit types, you can do this on the Unit Categories screen and the Unit Types screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can view and change the PMS unit type mappings and pricing offsets at any time. You'll need to re-optimize or run the nightly processes to see the effect of the changes on pricing.</p>
