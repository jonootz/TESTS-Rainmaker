        <h3>Break Factor Parameters</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>Break Factor High (#74)</p>
            <p>Break Factor Medium (#75)</p>
        </div>
        <p>These parameters are set as percentages.</p>
        <p>Another parameter that comes into play when Break Factors are used is Maximum Reference Rent Decrease (#152). This parameter is typically set at 3% or 5%.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>These parameters will affect Reference Rent which you can see on the Rent Comparison graph of the Pricing Trend Report. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system uses the break factors to decrease the reference rent in relation to the market composite (competitor rents) when there is medium or high exposure and limited or no leasing activity. </p>

        </p>
        <p>In the above screenshot, the break factors have come into play on 11/26, 12/3, 12/10, 12/17, 12/24,  and 1/7. The reference rent (blue line) was decreased on each of those dates in response to medium or high exposure and limited or no leasing activity.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Let's say you have parameter #74 Break Factor High set to 50%. If your exposure is high and there is little to no leasing activity, when the DRRC is run this week, the LRO system will decrease the reference rent by 50% of the difference between the reference rent and the market composite (competitor rents). So if your reference rent was $1200 and the market composite was $1000, in a period of high exposure and little to no leasing activity, the reference rent would be decreased by $100 which is 50% of the difference between the reference rent ($1200) and the market composite ($1000).</p>
        <p>Note that the amount the reference rent can be decreased is limited by  parameter 152 Maximum Reference Rent Decrease.  In the above example, if the Maximum Reference Rent is 3%, the reference rent could only decrease by $36 which is 3% of $1200.</p>
