        <p>Parameters are typically established by management at the regional or corporate level of your organization with the help of Rainmaker consultants.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3>Find the Right Balance</h3>
            <p>There are different factors to consider when setting parameters. It is important to find the right balance between them to help ensure the goals of different groups are taken into account in the pricing recommendations.</p>
            <h3>Consider the Different Factors</h3>
            <p>When setting parameters, you should consider the business strategies of the owner, management company, market, and/or community. </p>
            <p>You should also consider seasonality since settings for the slow leasing season (winter) will differ from those in the busier leasing season (spring/summer).</p>
            <h3>Be Proactive</h3>
            <p>You should adjust your parameter settings for seasonality a few weeks ahead of the change in leasing seasons. </p>
            <h3>Be Patient</h3>
            <p>The LRO system is designed to make incremental increases/decreases in price as opposed to big, drastic changes. It takes a few weeks to really see the impact of the new settings so it is important to give the LRO system time to work with your settings after you change them.</p>
