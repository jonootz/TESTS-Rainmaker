        <h3>Drop Rate</h3>
        <p>The Drop Rate is set on the Renewal Config Parameters screen which you can find at <span class="bold">Admin</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Parameters</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Renewal Config</span>.</p>
        <p class="note">This parameter is entered in the Rate field for the range or ranges that are less than 0.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This parameter allows you to specify how much of the difference between the resident's current rent and the new move-in rent should the rent be decreased for the renewal offer. This comes into play in the case of inverted leases when the new move-in rent is less than the resident's current rent.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p class="less_space">Drop Rate: 20%</p>
            <p class="less_space">Resident's Current Rent: $1500</p>
            <p class="less_space">
                <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> New Move-In Rent $1200</p>
            <p class="less_space">Difference between Resident's Current Rent and the New Move-In Rent: $300 ($1500 - $1200)</p>
            <p class="less_space">Renewal Decrease: $210 ($300 X 20%)</p>
            <p class="less_space">Renewal Offer: $1290 ($1500 + $210)</p>
        </div>
        <p class="note">The renewal decrease may be capped by the  Min Increase parameter.</p>
        <p>This is an example of how the drop rate works. However, as a best practice, you may want to set the drop rate to 0%. This will keep the resident's rent the same and allow you room to negotiate a decrease, if necessary. Most residents expect their rent to go up when they renew so they may be happy to continue paying the current amount. Don't assume you have to drop rents to get the resident to renew their lease.</p>
