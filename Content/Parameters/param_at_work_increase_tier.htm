        <h3>Increase Tier</h3>
        <p>The Increase Tier parameter (#122) adjusts the new move-in rent down before applying parameters such as the Increase Rate when calculating the renewal offer.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This is used in situations where the community has recently seen strong rent growth. Rents on available units may be quite high, perhaps at an all-time high. If there is limited availability, it is not uncommon to try charging very high rents. However, this strategy might not work as well for renewals since the higher rents may cause mass move-outs. The increase tier allows you to continue to push for higher rents on new move-ins while allowing renewal offers to be a little more inline with what you can really rent the apartments for if they were to become available.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p class="less_space">
                <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> new move-in rent: $1800</p>
            <p class="less_space">Increase Tier: 3%</p>
            <p class="less_space">Tier-adjustment Amount: $54 ($1800 X 3%)</p>
            <p class="less_space">Tier-adjusted move-in rent: $1746 ($1800-$54)</p>
        </div>
        <p class="less_space">The tier-adjusted move-in rent of $1746 will be used in the renewal pricing calculation instead of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> new move-in rent of $1800.</p>
