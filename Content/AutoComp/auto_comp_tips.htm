        <h2>Competitors Who Have Rent Control Units</h2>
        <p>If a competitor has rent control units, you should not set it up as an Automated Comps competitor because the lowest rent is the rent that is returned and that could be the rent control price. However, if a competitor has rent control units, but uses a specific unit type for those units, you can use that competitor with Automated Comps as long as you don't map to the rent control unit type.</p>
        <h2>Concessions</h2>
        <p>Automated Comps rents do not include concessions. If you are aware that a competitor uses concessions, you will need to manually shop them. You can enter concessions as an override to an Automated Comps rent, if necessary.</p>
        <h2>Reasons Automated Comps May Not Find A Rent</h2>
        <p class="less_space">Automated Comps may not find a rent because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> the competitor doesn't have any available units for the unit type</li>
            <li>the competitor unit type was not entered correctly (no bed and bath information or wrong bed, bath, or square footage)</li>
        </ul>
