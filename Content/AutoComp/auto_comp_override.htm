        <h1>Reviewing and Overriding Competitor Rents from Automated Comps</h1>
        <p>By default, Automated Comps will get comp rents two days before the DRRC is scheduled to run. This way you can review the rents and address any issues or make any overrides before the DRRC runs for the week.  </p>
        <p>You can also manually run Automated Comps  by clicking Run Auto Comp on the Comp Rents screen. This runs Automated Comps for all competitors for that community who are set up to use Automated Comps. </p>
        <p class="note">You can change the number of days using parameter 320.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Automated Comps:reviewing rents;reviewing Automated Comps rents;competitor rents:reviewing Automated Comps rents" />Reviewing Automated Comps Rents</h2>
        <p>To review Automated Comps rents, you'll go to <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Competitors</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Comp Rents</span>.</p>
        <p>For competitors who use Automated Comps, you'll just need to go review the rents each week to make sure that new rents were retrieved and that they are ok. If there are any problems, you'll see exceptions at the top of the screen. Also, there are circle icons that represent each unit type for a competitor which is set up for Automated Comps. These circles should be green. If there is a problem with the rent for a unit type, the corresponding circle will be yellow-orange. If Automated Comps is turned on for the competitor, but not for a unit type, the corresponding circle will be grey.</p>

        <p>If the base rent is not correct or if the competitor is offering a concession, you can override the Automated Comps rent. To do this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Competitors</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Comp Rents</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>On the Comp Rents screen, select the competitor you want to update on the left.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Set the toggle under the Comp Rent that you want to change to Override.</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the Base Rent and Concession, if applicable.</p>
                <p class="note">The Base Rent is the starting rent for a 12 month lease for that floorplan. The Concession is the total dollar value of the concession for a 12 month lease.</p>

        <h3>Keep in Mind</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once you have overridden an Automated Comps rent, that rent will remain in place until the next time Automated Comps runs after the DRRC has run. This ensures your override is used in the next DRRC run. </li>
            <li>The next time Automated Comps runs after the DRRC has run, it will get a new rent for this comp unit type and the toggle will be set back to Auto Comp. </li>
            <li>If you manually change the toggle back to Auto Comp, then Automated Comps will get a new rent the next time it runs regardless of whether or not the DRRC has run.</li>
        </ul>
