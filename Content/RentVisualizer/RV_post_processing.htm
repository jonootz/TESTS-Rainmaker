        <p MadCap:conditions="">The final stage<span class="bold"> results in what is referred to as the recommended rent before any amenities or pricing offsets are applied</span>. Once the amenities and/or any offsets are considered, then this value should match the Base rent on the New Pricing report. This post optimization stage applies any rounding rules that are in effect. It also applies any lease expiration management premiums or Rec Gen premiums that have been configured.</p>
