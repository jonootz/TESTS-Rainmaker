        <h3>Status Filter</h3>
        <p class="less_space">The possible statuses the leases can have are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Given Notice</li>
            <li>Renewed</li>
            <li>Undecided</li>
            <li>Month to Month (only available on report if opened from the Renewals report and the community/unit type has month to month leases)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, the report will display information for all statuses, but you can use this filter to only display the information for a particular status.</p>
        <h3>Undecided Lease Alert</h3>
        <p>Use this alert to highlight undecided leases that expire within a certain number of days.</p>
        <p>By default, the notation for your undecided leases will be highlighted if they expire in 15 days or less. </p>
        <p class="note">  This only affects the Undecided leases information on the report.</p>
        <p>Type the number of days in the Undecided Lease Alert text box and click <span class="bold">OK</span>. In the Undecided leases section, the Notation column will be highlighted in yellow for any leases that expire in that number of days or less.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Group Leases By</h3>
        <p>By default, the leases are grouped by status, then community, but you can group them by community, then status, if you want to. You would do this if you have opened the report and then refreshed it and selected to view multiple communities. By default, the information is only for the community for the renewals number you selected on the Renewals report.</p>

        <h3>New Lease Signed</h3>
        <p>This allows you to filter the report to only show expiring leases which have a new lease signed or to only show expiring leases which do not have a new lease signed.</p>
        <p class="note">This filter is only available on the report when opened from the Renewals report.</p>
        <h2>Notations</h2>
        <p>The report contains a Notations column that is used to give you additional information about the expiring leases depending on the status of the lease.</p>
        <p>For Undecided Leases, the notation will display the number of days until the lease expires. The notation will be highlighted in yellow if the lease expires in the number of days specified on the Undecided Lease Alert or less. For expired leases, the notation will display the number of days since the lease expired highlighted in red.</p>

        </p>
        <p>For leases with Given Notice and Moved Out status, the notation will display the new lease information if a new lease has been signed. If no new lease has been signed, the notation will be highlighted in orange.</p>
