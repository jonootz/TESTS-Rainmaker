        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Revenue Per Unit (RPU) report can be accessed from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. </p>
        <p>This report  gives you an indication of how a community's occupancy and rents are impacting revenue. RPU is calculated by multiplying the number of occupied units by the average rent of the occupied units and then dividing by the total number of units. The information used in these calculations comes from the Summary Analysis report. </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/select_hierarchy_when_open_report.flsnp" />
        <p MadCap:conditions="">There are two ways to view this report, with RPU as a bar or with RPU as a line.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="">Viewing  RPU&#160;as a bar allows you to quickly compare the RPU with the average rent for your occupied units since average rent is represented by a bar. Viewing RPU as a line allows you to quickly see how your RPU is trending with your occupancy which is represented by a line.</p>
