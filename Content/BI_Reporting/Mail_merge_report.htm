        <p>The Renewals Mail Merge report can be run from the Reporting tab in the LRO Web UI. </p>
        <p>This report is used to create renewal letters. It allows you to export pricing for all expiring leases and renewal offers for the selected period of time. This report would typically be run whenever you are generating renewal offers, which is usually monthly.</p>
        <h2>Viewing the Report</h2>
        <p>When you open the report, you'll be given a prompt to make your filter selections and run the report. </p>
        <p>To run the mail merge report:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select the Mail Merge report on the Reporting tab in the LRO Web UI.</p>
                <p>The report will open in the Business Objects portal with the Prompts dialog shown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure the first prompt under Prompts Summary is selected (Enter value for Curr Lease Exp Date (Start)).</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select or enter the start date.</p>

            <li>Select the second prompt under Prompts Summary (Enter value for Curr Lease Exp Date (End)). </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select or enter the end date.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="note">If you accidentally enter a start date that is later than the end date, the report will be blank.</p>

            <li>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">If your report is very large, you'll use the page functionality instead of continuously scrolling down.</p>

        </p>
        <div class="no_break">
            <p>To rerun the report with different filter selections, you can click the Refresh button.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="note">The filters for this report are all on the Prompt screen that appears when you run the report. This report does not use filters from the Input Controls or Filter Bar like some of the other reports do. Since these filters are not available, you may see a note about adding them. You do not need those filters for this report so you should not try to add them.</p>
