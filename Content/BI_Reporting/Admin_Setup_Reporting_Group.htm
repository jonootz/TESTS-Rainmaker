        <p>A reporting group (also known as a hierarchy) determines the information that appears on many of the reports and how that information can be filtered.</p>
        <p class="note">Prior to release 14.11, you could set up a reporting hierarchy from the  Admin tab under Communities&gt;Hierarchy and if you had one set up there, it would initially show up as a reporting group under the Reporting Admin tab. Now, you can only set up hierarchies under the Reporting Admin tab.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/changes_made_after_daily_load.flsnp" />
        <p>The reporting group is a group of attributes. Attributes values are assigned to your properties.  When you view some reports, you will select the reporting group you want to use. The reporting group determines which properties are included on the report and how you can filter the information.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Default.ExternalOnly">
            <span class="bold">Make sure you give everyone using the reports a list of the attributes that make up each reporting group (in the correct order). Some reports can be filtered by levels which correspond to the order of the attributes in a reporting group. The report will just show "Level 1", "Level 2", etc. so you need to make sure everyone knows what each level is.</span>

If this happens, you can change the order of the attributes to make sure they match how they appear on the reports.</p>
        <h3>Change the Order of the Attributes in a Reporting Group</h3>
