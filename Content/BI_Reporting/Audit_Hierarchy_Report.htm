        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Viewing the Report</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">The report will open when you click the Audit Hierarchy link on the Reporting tab. There are two tabs on the report, Hierarchy and Unassigned. </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Hierarchy Tab</h2>
        <p>The Hierarchy tab shows you all the details about the hierarchies that have been set up and which communities have been assigned attribute values for attributes within the hierarchy and what those attribute values are. </p>

        <h3>Reporting Group Name Filter</h3>
        <p>By default, the report will include all reporting groups you have set up. If you have multiple reporting groups set up, you can filter the report to only show a particular reporting group.</p>
        <h3>Active Filter</h3>
        <p>By default, the report will include both active and inactive communities. You can filter the report to only show one or the other.</p>
        <p class="note">The Is Active column indicates if a community is active or not.</p>
        <h3>Filter Bar</h3>
        <p>Another way you can filter the information on the report is using the Filter Bar. The attribute filters will appear right below the toolbar. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>There is a filter for each attribute in the reporting groups or selected reporting group. The drop list for each filter contains the values for each attribute. If you select a value, only properties that have that value assigned for that attribute will be included in the report.</p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Unassigned Tab</h2>
        <p>The Unassigned tab shows you a list of any communities that have not been assigned an attribute value for attributes in any hierarchies. Unassigned communities will not appear on any reports.</p>
