        <p MadCap:conditions="">There are two different views of the report, a Detail view and a Drill view. The filters for these views are independent of each other. For example, if you have the Detail view filtered for a particular community and then switch to the Drill view, the Drill view will not automatically be filtered for that community.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">You can use the Input Controls to filter the report by Community and Unit Type. You can  choose whether or not to include amenities in the rent amounts. You can also filter the report to only show a particular quarter or selection of quarters. These filters are the same on each view of the report.</p>

        <p>In addition to the Input Controls mentioned previously, you can filter the Drill view by drilling down to the different levels on the report using the headings. A section of the report is created for each attribute when you drill down.</p>

        <p class="note">Each heading is a value of a particular attribute. The attributes (levels) come from the Reporting Group (hierarchy) set up under the Reporting Admin tab. The headings (attribute values) are also set up under the Reporting Admin tab. </p>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>You can see the levels you have drilled down to in the Filter Bar. You can make different selections for a level using the Filter Bar if you want to.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/BI/filter_bar_drill_tab_SA.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you have selected a level that has quite a few attributes, you may want to use the Navigation Map to easily navigate to each section of the report, instead of paging through the report to find a particular section.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/navigation_map_button.flsnp" />
        <p>You can take a snapshot of the Drill view, if you want to. This is great for comparing information. For example, you might drill down to a particular region and take a snapshot. Then drill down to a different region and take a snapshot. Then you can easily compare the snapshots of the two regions.</p>
