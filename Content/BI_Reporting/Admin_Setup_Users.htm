        <p class="note">User information comes from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> database as part of the nightly processes. Users that appear under the Reporting Admin tab have REPORTING.MODULE rights and REPORTING Report Access All Properties property rights and/or REPORTINGADMIN.ReportingAdmin rights.  They also have valid email addresses. </p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>I don't see a user on the Users screen.</h3>
        <p class="less_space">Possible Reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The nightly processes haven't run since the user was set up or updated.</li>
            <li>The user doesn't have a valid email address.</li>
            <li>The user hasn't been set up with the necessary rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users come over from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> database as part of the nightly processes. If you set up a user under the  Admin tab, it should show up on the Users screen under the Reporting Admin tab the next day.</p>
        <p>In order for users to appear on the Reporting Admin Users screen, they must be set up with at least one of the following rights: REPORTINGADMIN.ReportingAdmin, REPORTING.MODULE, REPORTING.* property rights (REPORTING Report Access All Properties). Users also must have a valid email address.</p>
