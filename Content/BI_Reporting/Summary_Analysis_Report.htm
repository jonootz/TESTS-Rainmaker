        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Summary Analysis Report can be accessed from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI.  </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">This report summarizes information so you can quickly analyze performance at the corporate, community,  and unit type level. You can see monthly, quarterly, and YTD information. You would typically view this report weekly to quickly assess how your communities are doing. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/view_ut_and_community_level.flsnp" /></p>

        <h2>Viewing the Report</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/select_hierarchy_when_open_report.flsnp" />
        <p MadCap:conditions="">There are two views of the report, Detail and Drill. You can switch between the two views using the tabs at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/BI/summary_analysis_tabs.png" title="Click to view larger" /> </p>
        <p>The information on both views of the report is shown by month grouped by quarter and by year. There are quarterly averages and YTD averages as well. The Drill view allows you to easily drill down to different levels of your hierarchy. The information on the Drill view is shown separately for each attribute in the level being displayed, instead of all being together. </p>
        <p>You can filter the report by community and unit type. You can also choose whether or not to include amenities in the rent amounts.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="">Each view of the report has its own filters. For example, if you select to view the Detail view for a particular community and then switch to the Drill view, you will have to select that particular community again for the Drill view, if that is the only community you want to see.</p>

        <h2>Detail View</h2>
        <p>When you open the Summary Analysis Report, you'll be taken to the Detail view. This view shows you the monthly, quarterly, and yearly information based on the filter selections you have made using the Input Controls.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/BI/summary_analysis_detail_view.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note">You can also use the Filter Bar to filter the report using the attributes in your hierarchy.</p>
        <h2>Drill View</h2>
        <p>The Drill view is similar to the Detail view, but it displays the information broken out by attribute for the selected hierarchy level. For example, if the displayed hierarchy level has 6 attributes, the report will be broken down into the 6 attributes. When you view the Drill tab, the report will be filtered to show level 1 of the hierarchy, by default.</p>

        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>You can take a snapshot of the Drill view, if you want to. This is great for comparing information. For example, you might drill down to a particular region and take a snapshot. Then drill down to a different region and take a snapshot. Then you can easily compare the snapshots of the two regions.</p>
