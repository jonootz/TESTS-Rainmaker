        <h2>Drill Down</h2>
        <p>The Overview page can be filtered by drilling down on the graph labels. You can use the Filter Bar at the top of the report to change the drill selections. You can also use the filter bar to see the levels you have drilled down through to get to the current one. </p>
        <p>To drill down on the Overview page:</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>Click on the graph label to drill down to the next level in the hierarchy. When you hover over the label, you can see which level you will be drilling down to.</p>

            </p>
            <p>All of the graphs will change to show details from the next level in the hierarchy. You can see which levels you have drilled down to at the top of the report and in the Filter Bar above the report.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To drill back up, click the Level in the Current Occupancy &amp; 60 Day Exposure graph. This will change all of the graphs to show details from one level higher than the current level.</p>
