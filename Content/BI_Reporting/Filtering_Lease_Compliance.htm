            </a>Filtering the Overview</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">You can use the Input Controls to filter the report and control how the information is displayed. </p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Community Name Filter</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Community filter allows you to run the report for all communities, multiple communities, or a specific community.</p>
        <p>By default, the report includes all communities that you have access to that use an attribute in the selected hierarchy. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/select_multiple_communities.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/apply_community_filter.flsnp" />
        <h2>Level to Display Filter</h2>
        <p>By default, the  report displays information for Level 1. For example, you may have a reporting group set up with Corporate as Level 1. The Corporate attribute has one value called Corporate and it is applied to all properties.  This allows you to roll up information at the corporate level and then use the Level to Display filter to display the information broken out by other attributes. For example, if Level 4 is State, if you select to display Level 4, the report will be shown with the information broken out by state.</p>
        <div class="no_break">
            <p class="note">The Level to Display filter is useful when no other filters are selected or if you have selected multiple communities. It is not very useful if you have selected one filter item. For example, if you have selected one community in the community filter, the report will only show information for the selected community at every level you select.</p>
        </div>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/levels_are_attributes.flsnp">
        </MadCap:snippetBlock>
        <p>When you view the report by  level, each value for the level is shown on its own page. For example, if you selected Level 4 which is State, each page displays the report by a different state. You can see the attribute value in the filter box next to Hierarchy and Level Value. </p>
        <p>Use the Level to Display drop-list to select the level you want to display.</p>

        <h2>Show Compliant Leases As</h2>
        <p>The compliant leases will be shown as a percentage of all leases signed for that month. This filter allows you to display the actual number of leases that were compliant instead, if you want to.</p>
        <p class="note">The Compliance Alert is based on the percentage. Months where the compliant rate was below the specified percentage will still be highlighted if the compliant rate is shown as an amount.</p>
        <h2>Show Non Compliance Variance As</h2>
        <p>The non compliance variance is the difference between the actual effective rent and the recommended rent for the non-compliant leases. By default, this is shown as a percentage, but you can show it as a dollar amount, if you want to.</p>
        <h2>Compliance Alert</h2>
        <p>This is used to highlight months with a compliant rate that falls at or below a specified percentage. </p>
        <p>Type the percentage in the Compliance Alert text box and click <span class="bold">OK</span>. Any months that have a compliant rate that falls at or below the specified percentage will be highlighted in yellow.</p>

        <h2>Display Leases</h2>
        <p>By default, the lease compliance information is broken out monthly to show the current month to date and the past 12 months. You can display this information quarterly instead, if you want to. Displaying the information quarterly will show the current quarter to date and the past 4 quarters.</p>
