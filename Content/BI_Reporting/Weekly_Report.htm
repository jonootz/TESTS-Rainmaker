        <p>The Weekly Report can be accessed from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. </p>
        <p>This report provides a snapshot of where the community stands for the current week in regards to occupancy, exposure, and changes in rents. The Alert input controls allow you to highlight communities that are above or below certain thresholds. This report is useful for a variety of people within your organization, including site teams, regional/corporate operations teams, and pricing analysts.</p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="">Each view of the report has its own filters. For example, if you select to view the KPI Focus Page for a particular community and then switch to the Occupancy &amp; Exposure  view, you will have to select that particular community again for the Occupancy &amp; Exposure view, if that is the only community you want to see. However, alert settings will persist across views. For example, if you set the Exposure Alert to 30 on the KPI Focus Page view, it will be set to 30 on the Occupancy &amp; Exposure view also. The Show Traffic Within filter will also persist across views.</p>
