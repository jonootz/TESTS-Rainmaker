        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system has powerful Business Intelligence reporting. This reporting is more flexible than other reporting in the  <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system since you are not tied to the 5 level, fixed hierarchy structure.  The standard reports and dashboards allow you to quickly see your key performance indicators so you can identify your top and bottom performers. You can filter the reports to view the information in different ways. Having this information at your fingertips allows you to focus on decision making instead of data analysis.</p>
        <p>The Business Intelligence reports are located under the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. When you click on a report, it will open in the Business Objects portal in a new window. </p>

        <p>The reports you see here are determined by your access rights.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.ExternalOnly">The Reporting Admin tab is where the administrative setup is done for Business Intelligence reporting. This will typically be done  by an LRO implementation or support specialist. If you have access to this tab, you may want to consult with an LRO implementation or support specialist before making any changes in this area.</p>
