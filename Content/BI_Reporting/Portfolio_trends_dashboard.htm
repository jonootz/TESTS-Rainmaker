        <p>The Portfolio Trends Dashboard can be run from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. </p>
        <p>This dashboard is useful for anyone that wants to gauge performance at a community or group of communities. It will most likely be used by someone in the corporate office such as a VP, Regional Manager, Pricing Analyst, or Owner. </p>
        <p>Much of the information you'll find on the Portfolio Trends Dashboard is also displayed in the Weekly Report. The Weekly Report provides a snapshot in time for a community, which provides information on where the community stands today and what has happened over the last 60 days. The Portfolio Trends Dashboard helps illustrate this information through charts and graphs. The Occupancy and Rent Trends section shows a 90 day trend. You can also view the information on the dashboard in a table view by clicking on the table icon in the upper right corner of each section.</p>
        <p>The Expiring Leases section provides additional information that is not on the Weekly Report. It gives you insight into the renewal retention for residents with expiring leases in the current month and the next month.</p>

                <p>To see the dashboard for all communities, select Corporate as the Attribute and Corporate as the Attribute Value. Don't select a Community. This is a common hierarchy structure that you probably have set up. All communities that have the Corporate attribute value assigned to them will be included.

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <h3>Hierarchies (Reporting Groups)</h3>
        <p>The Hierarchies, Attributes, and Attribute Values come from the Reporting Groups that are set up under the Reporting Admin tab. </p>
        <p>You may want to set up a reporting group specifically for the Portfolio Trends Dashboard. Reporting Groups determine which information you see on a report or dashboard and how you can filter that information. For example, you may want to be able to view the information by Region or City. Your existing hierarchy or hierarchies may already be set up with the selections you need for this dashboard, but just know that you can set up a hierarchy to use specifically for this dashboard if you want to.  If you do set up a reporting group specifically for this dashboard, you may want to include "PTD" or "Portfolio Trend" or something in the name so you can easily identify it in the hierarchy list.</p>
        <p class="note">Only information for communities that are  assigned the selected attribute value will be included in the dashboard. Attribute values are assigned in the Property section under the Reporting Admin tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI.</p>
        <h3>Expiring Leases</h3>
        <p>You can click on the Month in the Expiring Leases section to see which leases fall under each status.</p>
