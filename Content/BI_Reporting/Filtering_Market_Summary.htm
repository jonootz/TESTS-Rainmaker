        <p>There are two different views of the report, an Overview and a Detail view. The filters for these views are independent of each other. For example, if you have the Overview filtered for a particular community and then switch to the Detail view, the Detail view will not automatically be filtered for that community.</p>
        <h2>
            <a name="Filterin">
            </a>Filtering the Overview</h2>
        <h2>Community Filter</h2>
        <p>Click on a community on the initial Overview page to see information about that community and its competitors.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You'll see charts representing the unit count by unit type for the community, occupancy for the community and its competitors, average effective rent/square foot by unit type for the community, and average effective rents for the community and its competitors for all unit types.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Unit Type Filter</h2>
        <p>You can click on a unit type in the pie chart to change the bar graphs so you'll see a comparison of the average effective rent/square foot for the selected unit type for the competitors and the community and a comparison of average effective rents for the selected unit type for the competitors and community. </p>
        <p class="note">The occupancy graph is not shown when you select a unit type.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">To select another unit type, you can just click the unit type in the pie chart. You don't have to clear the unit type filter first.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="no_break">
            <p>To return to the initial Overview where you see all of the communities, click the Clear Filters button under Community (ID) in the Input Controls. If you filtered down to the unit type level, you should clear the My Unit Type filter first. Otherwise, you will only see communities that have that unit type on the initial Overview screen.</p>
