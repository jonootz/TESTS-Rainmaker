        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Renewals Report can be accessed from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. </p>
        <p>This report provides useful information about your renewals. Pricing Analysts can use this report to make decisions on renewal strategy and even whether or not to re-negotiate offers if a large number of notices have come in. Regional Managers and Site Teams can use this report to gauge progress for upcoming expirations and follow up with residents who are undecided or have given notice.</p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Overview</h2>
        <p>After you select your hierarchy on the Prompts dialog and click OK, the report will open in the Overview. The Overview contains two graphs that help you review your expiring leases and renewals.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/BI/overview_renewals.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="less_space">The Overview graphs show you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> how many leases  are expiring in the month and the renewal status for those leases</li>
            <li>the difference between the move in rent and the current rent for the leases that are expiring in the month</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, the information shown on both graphs is for the current month, but you can use the Input Controls to view it for the next month, two months out, or three months out, as well.</p>
        <p class="note">Up-Down information is not available three months out.</p>
        <h3>Monthly Counts</h3>
        <p>This graph shows you a breakdown of the status of the leases that are expiring in the displayed month.</p>
        <p>This gives you insight into your current month expirations. You can see how many of the expiring residents have renewed, given notice, or are undecided.</p>
        <h3>Variance Graph</h3>
        <p>This graph shows you the difference between the rent for new move ins vs the rent for the expiring leases.   This is also known as Up - Down since it shows you if the rents are up or down. If it’s green, then the new move ins are higher than the expiring leases and if it’s red, then the new move ins are lower than the expiring leases. This information is useful for making decisions regarding renewal parameters and how aggressive or conservative to be.</p>
        <p>If the new move ins are considerably higher,  there is more room to grow renewal rents. If the rents are closer together or the new move-ins are less than the expiring leases, then it may make sense to incorporate a renewal strategy around a minimum increase. </p>
        <p class="note">This graph is not shown if you view the information for three months out.</p>
        <div class="no_break">
            <h3>Tip</h3>
            <p>You can drill down on the graphs by clicking on the hierarchy level on either graph. This will adjust both graphs to drill down to the next level in the hierarchy. To drill back up, you can click the Level on either graph. </p>

        <p>You can control the level of detail you see on the report by viewing it at the hierarchy level, the hierarchy and community level, or at the hierarchy, community, and unit type level.</p>
        <p>By default, the amounts on the report are shown with amenities, but you can choose to show them without amenities, if you want to.</p>
