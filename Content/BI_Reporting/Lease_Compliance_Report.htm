        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Lease Compliance Report can be accessed from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">This report is used to track a community's lease compliance rates, at a high level, over a period time.  It is an auditing tool that tracks how often rent overrides are occurring at a community. It can be used by anyone who wants to see how well their teams are accepting LRO's pricing recommendations. This would typically be revenue managers, pricing managers, or someone at the corporate office. </p>

        <h2>Viewing the Report</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/select_hierarchy_when_open_report.flsnp" />
        <p MadCap:conditions="">There are two views of the report, Overview and Detail, plus a Definitions page. You can switch between them using the tabs at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/BI/LCR_tabs.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="">Each view of the report has its own filters. For example, if you select to view the Detail view for a particular community and then switch to the Drill view, you will have to select that particular community again for the Drill view, if that is the only community you want to see.</p>

        <p>After you select your hierarchy on the prompts screen and click OK, the report will open in the Overview. The Overview contains two graphs that help you explore your lease compliance.</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/BI/LCR_overview.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="less_space">The Overview graphs show you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the number of leases that were signed and the percentage of those leases that were at the compliant rate (LRO recommended rate)</li>
            <li>a comparison of your average CPR Effective Rent to the average Recommended Rent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use the Input Controls to view the report for a specific community or group of communities. You can also view the report at different hierarchy levels using the Level to Display input control. You can click on a bar in the Lease Count and Percentage at Compliance Rate graph to change the Average CPR Effective Rent &amp; Recommended Rent Comparison graph to only show information for that month.</p>
        <p class="note">All rent amounts shown include amenities. The current month is shown month to date.</p>

            <p>This shows you the number of leases that were signed and what percentage of those were signed at the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> recommended rate. The leases are included in a month based on the contract date. You can see this information for the current month plus the past 12 months. </p>

            <h3>Average CPR Effective Rent &amp; Recommended Rent Comparison</h3>

        <p>You can control the level of detail you see on the report by viewing it at the hierarchy level, the hierarchy and community level, or at the hierarchy, community, and unit type level.</p>
        <p>The compliant rate is shown as a percentage by default, but you can show it as an actual lease count, if you want to.</p>
        <p>By default, the non-compliance variance is shown as a percentage, but you can choose to show it as a dollar amount.</p>
