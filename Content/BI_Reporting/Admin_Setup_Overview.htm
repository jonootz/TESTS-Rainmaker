        <p>There are two places in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI where you set up information for using Business Intelligence reporting. Some information is set up under the  Admin tab and some is set up under the Reporting Admin tab. </p>

                <p class="note">Prior to release 14.11, you could set up a reporting hierarchy from the  Admin tab under Communities&gt;Hierarchy and if you had one set up there, it would initially show up as a reporting group here. Now, you can only set up hierarchies under the Reporting Admin tab.</p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">When  Changes Will Take Effect</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Changes that you make on the Reporting Admin tab and user setup under the  Admin tab will take effect after the nightly processes are run. So basically, after you make any changes to your Business Intelligence Admin setup, including adding users, you'll have to wait until the next day for them to take effect.</p>
