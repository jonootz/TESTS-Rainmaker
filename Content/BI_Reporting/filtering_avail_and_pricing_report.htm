            </a>Filtering the Overview</h2>
        <p>The Overview page can be filtered by drilling down on the graph labels. You can use the Filter Bar at the top of the report to change the drill selections. You can also use the filter bar to see the levels you have drilled down through to get to the current one. </p>
        <p>To drill down on the Overview page:</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <div class="no_break">
                <p>Click on the hierarchy label on either graph to drill down to the next level in the hierarchy. When you hover over the label, you can see which level you will be drilling down to.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="no_break">
                <p MadCap:conditions="">Both graphs will change to show details from the next level in the hierarchy. You can see which levels you have drilled down to at the top of the report and in the Filter Bar above the report.</p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Community Filter</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Community filter allows you to run the report for all communities, multiple communities, or a specific community.</p>
        <p>By default, the report includes all communities that you have access to that use an attribute in the selected hierarchy. </p>

        <h2>Levels 1 - 3 Filters </h2>
        <p>You can choose to display information on the graphs for a particular attribute value in a level. For example, if level 3 is State, you could choose to view the information for a particular state. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/levels_are_attributes.flsnp">
        </MadCap:snippetBlock>
        <p> The filter for each level allows you to narrow the information down by attribute values. You can also see which values are included in each level.</p>
        <p>A reporting group can contain up to 10 levels, but it is uncommon to have that many. You can view the graph at a levels 1-10 by drilling down, but you can only filter the report by the attribute values for levels 1 - 3.</p>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>When you open the report, you will be prompted to select a date and a hierarchy. If you want to view the report using a different date or hierarchy, you can close and reopen it or select the refresh button.</p>
