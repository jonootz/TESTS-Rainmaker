        <p MadCap:conditions="">The Market Summary Report can be accessed from the Reporting tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI.  </p>
        <p>This report allows you to compare the occupancy and  rents for your properties and your competitors in different ways. It is useful for helping you spot negative trends quickly, with the added ability to drill down into the data for detailed analysis. </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>When you open the Market Summary report, you'll be taken to the Overview. This view allows you to compare communities based on number of units (size of box) and effective rent (color of box). Typically, there will be 5 colors on the Overview. Communities with similar effective rents will be the same color. An attempt is made to group the communities so each color has about the same number of communities. </p>
