        <h2>Competitor (Code) Filter</h2>
        <p>This allows you to filter the report to only see information for a particular competitor or selection of competitors.</p>
        <p class="note">To select multiple competitors, hold down the Ctrl key while you select each competitor. <br />If you want to select a group of sequential competitors, select the first competitors, then hold down the Shift key while you select the last competitor. The first and last competitors, plus all the competitors in between, will be selected.</p>
        <h2>Status Filter</h2>
        <p>This allows you to filter the report to see all competitors or only competitors that are stale or only competitors that are not stale.</p>
        <h2>Days Since Updated Filter</h2>
        <p>You can also filter the report based on the days since the competitor rent has been changed. For example, you would enter 20 to see any competitors whose rents haven't changed in 20 or more days. This works off the Rent Change Aging.</p>
        <h2>Show Rent History</h2>
        <p>You can use this filter to see competitor rent history going back 12 weeks from the report date. </p>
