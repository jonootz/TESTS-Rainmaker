        <p>Some setup is required to use <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" />'s Business Intelligence reports. This setup is initially done by an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> support or implementation specialist. Much of the setup is done under the Reporting Admin tab in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI. </p>

        <p>The Reporting Admin items you can set up are users, attributes, and reporting groups. You can also assign attributes to properties. This process can be complicated. You should have a support or implementation specialist walk you through the process before you attempt to do it on your own.</p>
