        <p class="less_space">However, you can use the refresh button to view the report for different communities, dates, and unit types. This filter will be useful if you have refreshed the report and selected options that cause multiple communities to appear on the report.</p>

        <h3>Status Filter</h3>
        <p class="less_space">The possible statuses the units can have are:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Vacant Unavailable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, the report will display information for all statuses, but you can use this filter to only display the information for a particular status.</p>
        <p class="note">The statuses that appear in the Input Control are those that are applicable to the units displayed on the report. For example, if you only have one unit on the report and its status is "Vacant Ready", then only "Select (All)" and "Vacant Ready" will appear in the Input Control.</p>
