        <p>On the Reporting Admin Property Attributes screen, you can add, edit, and delete attributes. Attributes are used to make up the reporting groups (hierarchies) you want to use for your Business Intelligence reports.</p>
        <p class="note">Prior to release 14.11, you could set up a reporting hierarchy from the  Admin tab under Communities&gt;Hierarchy and if you had one set up there, the property attributes set up there would initially show up here. </p>

        <h3>How Are Property Attributes Used</h3>
        <p>The property attributes are used to help you view your reporting information in ways that are beneficial to you. For example, you can view information at the corporate level which will include all of your properties, but then you can also view the information at the regional level or the state level if you have set up region and state attributes. The attributes will have values, for example, different regions such as Southeast and Northwest and different states such as Georgia and Oregon. You will assign the appropriate attribute values to your properties so the correct information is included when you view the information at different levels on the reports.</p>
        <p>Property attributes are set up here and then assigned to properties.</p>
