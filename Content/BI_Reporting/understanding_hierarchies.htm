            <MadCap:keyword term="business intelligence reporting:hierarchies;hierarchies:business intelligence reporting" />Hierarchies in Business Intelligence Reporting</h1>
        <p>Many Business Intelligence reports use hierarchies to display and filter the information. Hierarchies are also called Reporting Groups and are set up under the Reporting Admin tab.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NotPrint"><a href="Admin_Setup_Reporting_Group.htm">Learn about setting up hierarchies</a><![CDATA[    ]]></p>
        <p class="note">Since hierarchies determine the information that appears on the reports and how that information can be filtered, you may want to set up special hierarchies to use when viewing specific reports or dashboards. Keep in mind how you will be using a hierarchy when you name it. This will make it easier to know which hierarchy to select when you are viewing a report or dashboard that uses hierarchies. For example, if you are creating a hierarchy to only use with the Portfolio Trends Dashboard, you may want to put&#160;"PTD" or "Portfolio Trend" at the beginning of the name.</p>
        <p>When you open a report and select a hierarchy, only properties that have been assigned to at least one attribute in that hierarchy will appear on the report. (Assigning attribute values to properties is done under the Reporting Admin tab.)</p>
        <h3><a name="Levels"></a>How do I know which attributes the levels represent?</h3>
        <p>You may drill down on a report or filter it using the hierarchy levels. The levels are usually identified by the level number and not by the name of the level.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">You can see how your hierarchies are set up including the attribute names, values, and communities they are assigned to on the Audit Hierarchy report. This report is accessed from the Reporting tab. You can filter this report for a particular reporting group, if you have more than one.</p>
        <p>You can also go to the Reporting Group screen under the Reporting Admin tab. You'll see a list of your reporting groups. Click on the name of the reporting group you're using to view the report. You'll see a list of the attributes that make up the reporting group. The sort order column shows you the level number for each attribute. You may need to get this information from someone with access to the Reporting Admin tab, if you do not have this access.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.ExternalOnly">If an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> support or implementation specialist set up different groups for you, they should have given you the hierarchy information for the reporting group(s) at that time. If you do not have this information and you do not have access to the Reporting Admin tab or the Audit Hierarchy report, you can ask an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> support or implementation specialist to get it for you.</p>
