        <p>Lease Expiration Management (LEM) allows you to manage the lease expirations for each unit category at the property. When using LEM, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system recommends the desired expirations for each calendar month and then these expiration numbers get factored into the price optimization process. </p>
