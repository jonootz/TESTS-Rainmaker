            </a>Competitor Improvements</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <p class="less_space">The following improvements have been made regarding competitors and competitor rents:</p>
            <h3>Comp Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It's now easier to identify and add competitors using a map which populates with your location, your competitors' locations, and locations of other communities.</li>
                <li>You no longer have to enter a Comp ID when you set up a competitor. Also, the Comp ID was removed from any screens that used to display it.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="no_break">
                <h3>Comp Rents</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Comp Rents screen has been updated with a new look and feel. It is now easier to view and enter your comp rent information. </li>
                    <li>You can now edit competitor unit types from the Comp Rents screen by clicking the Gear icon on the right side of the section for the unit type.</li>
                    <li>Pricing history is now displayed all of the time in an easy to read graph. You can see how the comp rents have been trending and mouse over the points on the graph to see the actual amounts and who entered them.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the unit type mapping, you can now see the position of the competitor unit type.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Competitor Unit Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When you add a competitor, competitor unit types will automatically be created and mapped to a corresponding <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit type. You will just need to review the competitor unit types to make sure the information is correct. </p>
                    <p class="note">You can enter the bed and bath information for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit type to have it automatically entered for any new competitor unit types that get created.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Bed and bath information is now required for saving a competitor unit type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">The Competitor screens were removed from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Analyst tool. Entering and viewing competitor information should be done from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Web UI.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you open the report, there is an optional prompt to control how you want your traffic information to be displayed on the report. If you don't select anything here, the traffic information will be displayed for the past 7 days. You can select to display your traffic information for the past 7, past 14, or past 30 days.</li>
                <li>Occupancy, Exposure, and Renewal % are now displayed out to one decimal place.</li>
                <li>You can filter the Visits and Leases information by number of days. It defaults to whatever was selected from the Prompts screen when you opened the report. Your filter options are past 7 days, past 14 days, past 30 days, and default. This filter is persistent across tabs that use this filter.</li>
                <li>On the KPI Focus Page and the Asking &amp; Effective Rents page, there is a new column called Asking Rent vs All Leases. This compares your  current asking rent with the de-amenitized average effective rent for all leases. This allows you to see how much more/less you would be getting in rent if you replaced all of your current leases with new leases.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>On the KPI&#160;Focus Page and the Asking &amp; Effective Rents page, there is a new filter that allows you to display the rent differences as a percentage or as a dollar amount. This affects the following columns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asking Rent vs All Leases</li>
