            <MadCap:keyword term="competitor weights screen;competitor weights;competitor weights:entering;entering competitor weights" />Competitor Weights Screen</h1>
        <p>Competitor weights allow you to rank each competitor based on the amount of qualified traffic and leases shared with your community. Weights are entered as percentages with the more important competitors receiving greater values. The percentages must add up to 100% for each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit type.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system uses weights and positions when calculating the <a href="../Basics/market_composite.htm">market composite</a> which is the average of the competitor rents with weights and positions applied.</p>
        <p>Competitor weights are typically entered when you are setting up competitors as part of your initial community setup.</p>
        <h2>Using the Competitor Weights Screen</h2>
        <p>You'll find the Competitor Weights screen under <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Competitors</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Comp Weights</span>.</p>
        <h3>Entering Competitor Weights</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the Competitor Weights screen, click in the appropriate field to enter a weight for a competitor and unit type.</p>
                <p class="note">The unit type must be mapped to the competitor which is done as part of <a href="../Basics/setting_up_competitors.htm">comp setup</a>. If the field is not green, the unit type isn't mapped to that competitor so you can't enter a weight.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the weight amount. This is a percentage. </p>
                <p class="note">The weights entered for each unit type must add up to 100%.</p>
            </li>
            <li>When you have finished entering the weights, click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can click Balance under a unit type to have the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system balance the percentages out to equal 100% for that unit type.</li>
            <li>You can click Click to Re-Balance to have the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system balance the percentages out to equal 100% for all unit types.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system will balance out the percentages based on what is entered. You must have at least one percentage entered to have the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system balance the percentages.</p>
