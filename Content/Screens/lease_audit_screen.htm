            <MadCap:keyword term="lease audit screen;Lease Audit Report" />Lease Audit Report</h1>
        <p>The Lease Audit report shows you a comparison between the rents entered into the PMS system and the rents that the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system recommended for that particular date.</p>
        <h2>Using the Lease Audit Report</h2>
        <p>The Lease Audit Report gives you insight into whether or not your on-site teams are following the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system recommendations. </p>
        <p>It is important that the on-site teams follow the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system recommendations as closely as possible since the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system is basically adjusting prices based on how the marketplace is responding to the recommended prices.</p>
        <p class="note">You should be compliant 90+% of the time to see the best results in your revenue management.</p>
        <h2>Viewing the Lease Audit Report</h2>
        <p>You'll find the Lease Audit report under <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Lease Audit</span>.</p>
        <p class="note">There is also a <a href="../BI_Reporting/Lease_Compliance_Report.htm">Business Intelligence Lease Compliance Report</a> that has a graphical view of the lease compliance information and can be run for multiple communities.</p>
        <p>By default, you'll see the leases that were signed in the last 30 days for all unit types, but you can filter to see leases signed within as few as 7 and as many as 365 days. You can also filter the information for a particular unit type.</p>
        <p>You can quickly compare the Actual Effective Rent to the Recommended Effective Rent. You can also use this report to compare the prior rent and lease term to the current rent and lease term for a unit.</p>
