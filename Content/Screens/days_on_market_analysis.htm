        <p MadCap:conditions="">By default, the screen will show units that are available for rent. Typically, this would be units with the following statuses: On Notice, Vacant Ready, and Vacant Unavailable. However, you can show all units, if you want to.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Leasing pace zones are Slow, Medium, and Fast. The leasing pace is determined by the unit's days on market as compared to the average for the LRO unit type. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">You can click the Historical Leasing Pace for a unit to see which leases were used in calculating the unit's historical leasing pace. Parameters 264 and 265 are used to determine the time frame for the leases used in the calculation.</p>
