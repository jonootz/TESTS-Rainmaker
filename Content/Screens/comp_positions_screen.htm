            <MadCap:keyword term="competitor positions screen;competitor positions;entering competitor positions;competitor positions:entering" />Competitor Positions Screen</h1>
        <p>Competitor positions allow your community to compare with competitors who have a better  product or an inferior product. A position tells the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system how much more or less a customer would expect to pay at a competitor when compared to your community. Positions are entered as positive or negative dollar amounts.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO"></MadCap:variable> system uses weights and positions when calculating the <a href="../Basics/market_composite.htm">market composite</a> which is the average of the competitor rents with weights and positions applied.</p>
        <p>Competitor positions are typically entered when you are setting up competitors as part of your initial community setup.</p>
        <h2>Determining Competitor Positions</h2>
        <p class="less_space">The position can be explained with this question - In a stable market, would a customer expect to pay more, less, or about the same to live at this community compared to your community?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A positive position means the customer would expect to pay more to live at your community.</li>
            <li>A negative position means the customer would expect to pay less to live at your community.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Factors such as age, location, finishes, unit size, curb appeal, and amenities are often considerations when determining positions. </p>
        <p class="note">If necessary, you can use the Position Worksheet to assist you in determining positions. This can be found under LRO&gt;Competitors&gt;Position Worksheet.</p>
        <h2>Using the Competitor Positions Screen</h2>
        <p>You'll find the Competitor Positions screen under <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Competitors</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Comp Position</span>.</p>
        <h3>Entering Competitor Positions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the Competitor Positions screen, click in the appropriate field to enter a position for a competitor and unit type.</p>
                <p class="note">The unit type must be mapped to the competitor which is done as part of <a href="../Basics/setting_up_competitors.htm">comp setup</a>. If the field is not green, the unit type isn't mapped to that competitor unit type so you can't enter a position.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the position amount. This can be a positive or negative amount. </p>
            </li>
            <li>When you have finished entering the position, click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>At the bottom of the Competitor Position screen, you can see Competitor Summary information including weights, positions, effective rent, and the market composite for each unit type. You can see more details by going to LRO&gt;Competitors&gt;Comp Summary.</p>
