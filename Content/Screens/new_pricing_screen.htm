        <p>The New Pricing report shows the pricing for each apartment that is available to rent at the community, grouped by unit type. </p>
        <h2>Using the New Pricing Report</h2>
        <p>This report is used by leasing consultants when working with prospective residents. The leasing consultant will use the summary view first to narrow down the list of available apartments. Once an apartment is selected, the detail view can be used if the prospective resident would like a different lease term than the one shown on the summary view.</p>
        <p class="less_space">When working with prospective residents, try to understand what they are really looking for before quoting a price. Be sure they understand that pricing changes daily.</p>
        <p class="less_space">Some items to consider are:</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <p class="less_space">Which floor plan are they interested in?</p>
            <p class="less_space">When do they want to move in?</p>
            <p class="less_space">Is there a particular floor level they are interested in? (i.e., ground floor, top floor)</p>
            <p class="less_space">Would they like a particular view or does it matter?</p>
            <p class="less_space">Are they looking for a particular lease term other than the standard 12 month lease term?</p>
