            <MadCap:keyword term="competitor rents screen" />Competitor Rents Screen</h1>
        <p>The Competitor Rents screen is where the community site teams enter competitor rents each week.</p>
        <p class="note">Competitors are the communities in the area that your community competes with for traffic and leases. These are selected during the set up process and entered under Competitors&gt;Comp Setup.</p>
        <h2>Using the Competitor Rents Screen</h2>
        <p>This screen is updated each week by the community on-site associates who call, email, or go online to get each competitor's current pricing. (If the community uses Automated Comps, the rents are updated automatically and just need to be reviewed.) The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system uses this information to compare the competitor rent trends to your community's rent trend.</p>
        <p class="note">You should enter your competitor rents by the close of business on the day before your weekly pricing call. If you are using Automated Comps, you should review your comp rents and make any overrides  by the close of business on the day before your weekly pricing call.</p>
        <p>If a competitor has not been updated in the past week, they are considered "stale" and will show up with a red border on the screen. Competitors that are up to date will appear with a green border on the screen.</p>
        <h2>Updating the Competitor Rents Screen</h2>
        <p>You'll find the Competitor Rents screen under <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Competitors</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Comp Rents</span>.</p>
        <h3>Getting the Information</h3>
        <p>For reference, you can note your contact at the competitor community, a phone number, and a web address for the competitor community.</p>
        <p class="less_space">The information you should gather each week for each competitor community includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rent charged for each unit type</li>
            <li>Any concessions being offered for each unit type</li>
            <li>Number of visits to the community that week</li>
            <li>Number of leases signed for the community that week</li>
            <li>Occupancy % for the community </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Entering the Information</h3>
        <p>You'll <a href="../Basics/enter_comp_rents_manual.htm">enter the information manually</a> for competitors which don't use Automated Comps.</p>
        <p>You'll <a href="../AutoComp/auto_comp_override.htm">review and enter overrides</a>, if necessary, for competitors which use Automated Comps.</p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <h3>Pricing History</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>The pricing history information is shown for each unit type in a graph format. The comp rent is shown as a point on the graph. You can hover over the point to see the comp rent for that date and who entered it. The numbers on the left side of the Pricing History graph show the range that the rents fall into. The pricing history is displayed for 12 weeks, but you can show fewer weeks, if you want to.</p>
            <p>The Effective Rent will be shown in orange. If you are using Automated Comps, the Automated Comps rent will be shown in green. </p>
            <p class="note">The Effective Rent is the rent that is used as the comp rent. If you are using Automated Comps, the Automated Comps rent will be the Effective Rent unless an override has been made.</p>

        <h3>Mapping and Positions</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>You can quickly view the mapping and position info for a unit type. <a href="comp_positions_screen.htm">Positions</a> are set up under LRO&gt;Competitors&gt;Comp Position. The mapping is set up under LRO&gt;Competitors&gt;Comp Setup. However, you can quickly access the mapping and unit type setup information by clicking the Gear icon on the Comp Rents screen.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p> If there are any problems with the comp rents, you'll see exceptions at the top of the screen. </p>
            <p class="note">Also, there are circle icons that represent each unit type for a competitor which is set up for Automated Comps. These circles should be green. If there is a problem with the rent for a unit type, the corresponding circle will be yellow-orange. If Automated Comps is turned on for the competitor, but not for a unit type, the corresponding circle will be grey.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/WebUI/comp_rent_except_circles.png" />
            </p>
            <p>You can click on the Exceptions banner to see the list of exceptions. You can dismiss any or all of the exceptions here, if you want to. When you view the competitor information with a unit type that contains an exception, you will see it above the unit type that has the issue.</p>

        <h3>Stale Competitor</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>If you don't have new rents for a competitor, but you don't want it to remain stale since you are aware of this and have reviewed the competitor this week, you can simply click the X on the Stale Competitor banner to remove the stale status from the competitor. </p>

        <h3>Edit Competitor Unit Type</h3>
        <div class="no_break">
            <div class="indent">
                <p>You can click the Gear icon to edit the competitor unit type, instead of having to go back to the Comp Setup screen. This is especially useful to quickly verify that the competitor unit type is set up correctly if you are using Automated Comps, but not getting rents.</p>

        <h3>Running Automated Comps</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>If your community is set up to use Automated Comps, you can  manually run Automated Comps  by clicking Run Auto Comp on the Comp Rents screen. This runs Automated Comps for all competitors for that community who are set up to use Automated Comps. </p>
