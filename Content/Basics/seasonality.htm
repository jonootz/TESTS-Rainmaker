        <p>Demand Seasonality is the recurring chronological pattern of demand arrived across successive years.</p>
        <p>The Seasonality Curve gauges the average demand of the month or week against the average demand for the year.</p>
        <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system, you can view and adjust your seasonality on a graph under LRO&gt;Charts&gt;BI Charts. </p>
        <h3>How does the LRO system use seasonality?</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>By default, the LRO system uses three years of lease data (move ins and guest cards) to create the Demand Seasonality Curve. A minimum of 18 months of data is recommended.</p>
            <p>Seasonality is an input into the LRO system's overall Demand Forecast, which is an input into the optimization process along with Reference Rent, Supply Forecast, other Business Statistics, and configuration settings (for example, community parameters).</p>
            <p>Since there are many inputs into the optimization process, the final recommended pricing across the pricing horizon may not align exactly with the seasonality curve, in either time frame or magnitude.</p>
            <p>The LRO system optimizes across the pricing horizon and as a result, price increases may be observed ahead of a demand seasonality increase. In essence, the LRO system is anticipating the increased demand.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="note">Over the long term, it may be best to avoid steep peaks in seasonality.</p>
