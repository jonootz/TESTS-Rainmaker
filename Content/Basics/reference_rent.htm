            <MadCap:keyword term="reference rent" />Reference Rent</h1>
        <p>Reference rents are used as a starting point for pricing in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system. The reference rent is set at the unit type level and is the equilibrium point at which a higher price will decrease demand and a lower price will increase demand. </p>
        <h3>How does the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system use the reference rent?</h3>
        <p>Prices are optimized around the reference rent and may be higher or lower than the reference rent. </p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system is trying to increase demand (get more traffic/leases), then the price will likely be lower than the reference rent. </p>
        <p>If there is limited availability and future demand is expected to be strong, then the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system may price higher than the reference rent (because there is already more than enough demand to cover the apartments that are available).</p>
        <h3>Where does the reference rent come from?</h3>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system uses the DRRC (Dynamic Reference Rent Calculator) to set the reference rent.</p>
