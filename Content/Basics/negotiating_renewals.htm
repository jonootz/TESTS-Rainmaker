        <p class="less_space">Being prepared is one of the most important things you can do regarding negotiations. Here are a few tips for preparing for a renewal negotiation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule a specific time for the meeting so you are not caught off guard.</li>
            <li>Review the resident's lease. Have there been any customer service/maintenance issues over the course of the lease? Where they resolved in a timely manner? Are any issues still outstanding?</li>
            <li>Know what pricing looks like today as compared to when the renewal offer letter went out. Have prices increased, decreased, or are they about the same? Are more apartments available now?</li>
            <li>Understand how much room you have to negotiate the renewal offer. Is there something that can be offered other than rental discounts such as cleaning carpets or painting?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember if a resident is looking to negotiate, then they are looking for a way to stay at the community. Keep this in mind when negotiating the price. Just because you have $50 per month of negotiation room doesn't mean you should immediately offer up that decrease. The resident might be happy with a $20 decrease or with improvements to their apartment such as carpet cleaning or painting.</p>
