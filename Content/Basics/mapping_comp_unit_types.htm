        <p>After you add a competitor, you will need to verify the unit type mappings. When a new competitor is added, competitor unit types are automatically created and mapped based on your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit types. You can change these or add different ones, if necessary.</p>

            <li>Make sure the name, description, and square footage information are correct. Also, verify the bed and bath information under Automated Comp Settings. If Automated Comps is turned on, make sure the Base Rent is shown which means that a rent was found. If a rent is not found, make sure the bed, bath, and square footage range is correct.</li>
