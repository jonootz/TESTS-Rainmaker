        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system can accommodate most renewal strategies.</p>

            <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" />'s renewal pricing is determined based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the average new move-in rent at the time the lease expires</li>
            <li>the resident's current lease amount</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> parameter settings</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Renewal Pricing Considerations</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Current Perceived Rent (CPR)</span>: This is the resident's current rent amount. This is the starting point for determining the renewal price.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Move-in Rent</span>: The amount a new resident would pay if the current resident moves out. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Community Renewal Strategy</span>: This is captured in several parameters that define how the current perceived rent is treated in relation to the market rent. Parameters are used to communicate the renewal strategy to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system. Some important parameters are Increase Rate, Min Increase, Max Increase, Decrease Rate, and Increase Tier. Increase Tier is parameter 122. The other parameters are set on the Renewal Config Parameters screen.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Current Lease Type (Premium or Normal)</span>: Premium leases are leases that have a big premium which are typically short term and MTM (month-to-month) leases (5 months or less). Normal leases are longer term leases, typically 6 - 12+ months. A premium lease is automatically offered at the move-in rent price.</p>
