        <p>Exposure is the available vacant and on-notice apartments that are available to rent to prospective residents.</p>
        <p>If an apartment is on-notice, this means that the resident who is currently living there has notified the office that they will be moving out and the apartment has not been rented to a new resident yet.</p>
        <h3>How is exposure used by the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system?</h3>
        <p>Exposure is used by the DRRC in the calculation of reference rent. </p>
        <p class="note">You can view exposure graphs on the Pricing Trend report and on the Portfolio Trends Dashboard.</p>
