        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system understands that pricing for renewals is different than new lease pricing. It is designed to generate renewal pricing using the forecasting power of new pricing while keeping in mind the resident's current rent and your business strategy regarding renewals.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="renewal:offers;renewal offers" />Renewal offers are typically sent out 2-4 weeks before the required notice period. So if you require residents to give a 60 day notice, you would send the renewal offers out 75 to 90 days before the leases end.</p>
        <p class="note">You can generate renewal offer letters from the Renewal Pricing report.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="renewals:acceptance" />Typically, 45-60% of your renewal offers will be accepted. The rate of acceptance is determined by how aggressive your renewal strategy is, what your market is like, and what season it is.</p>
