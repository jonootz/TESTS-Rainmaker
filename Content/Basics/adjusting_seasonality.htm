        <p>In general, it is best to use the seasonality which is calculated by the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system. However, if you are familiar with demand patterns for your communities and strongly feel that the seasonality curve should be different from what was calculated, you can change it on the Seasonality Graph located under LRO&gt;Charts&gt;BI Charts.</p>
        <div class="no_break">
            <p class="less_space">Here are a few reasons that you may need to adjust your seasonality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have a new lease-up community with no prior leasing history.</li>
                <li>A community was newly acquired and has no leasing history.</li>
                <li>A community had a special event where unusual leasing activity occurred, such as a special promotion, road construction, a renovation, or a disaster such as a fire, flood, or tornado.</li>
                <li>Other reasons could be traffic management issues, marketing issues, or inconsistent data entry by site teams into the PMS system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="less_space">If you are not sure if your seasonality should be adjusted, then you shouldn't change it.</p>
