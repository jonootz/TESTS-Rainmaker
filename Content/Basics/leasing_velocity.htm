        <p>Leasing velocity is a conversion rate of traffic to leases, i.e. how many people of the people that visited your property rented an apartment.</p>
        <h3>How is leasing velocity calculated?</h3>
        <p>By default, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system will calculate leasing velocity by looking at 30 days of activity. A 30 day range should be enough time to get a good feel for recent leasing activity and make sure that one good or bad week doesn't represent the state of affairs at the community. More recent weeks are weighted the heaviest in this calculation so that the most recent leasing activity is given more relevance than what happened 25 to 30 days ago.</p>
        <p>You can use parameter 88 to adjust the number of days of activity that the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system uses to calculate leasing velocity, if necessary.</p>
        <p class="note">The Traffic &amp; Leasing section of the Pricing Trend report gives you a visual representation of your leasing velocity. You can also compare the number of guest cards and leases for the past 7 days on the Portfolio Trends Dashboard.</p>
