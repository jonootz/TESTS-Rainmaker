            <MadCap:keyword term="configurable lease terms" />Configurable Lease Terms</h1>
        <p>Lease terms are set up under LRO configuration or RecGen. However, you can configure your lease terms to offer different lease terms for new leases vs renewal leases. You can also offer different lease terms for your rent control units, if you have any.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="" class="less_space">For example, you can use configurable lease terms to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">limit new/renewal pricing offerings to 7-10 month lease terms (common in Florida)</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">offer 6-12 month lease terms for new leases and 2-12 month lease terms for renewals</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">seasonally switch on/off 13, 14, and 15 month lease terms (these lease terms must first be set up in RecGen or LRO configuration)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Lease Term Configuration screen is located under Admin&gt;Lease Term Configuration. </p>
        <p>Again, this isn't where you set up your lease terms.&#160;It is just where you specify which lease terms you want to use for each lease type. You can change these any time.</p>
        <p> Lease Term Configuration determines which lease terms will be displayed in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" />'s New Pricing  and Renewal Pricing screens. Pricing for the specified lease terms will be sent to your PMS system if you are using Yardi, AMSI, or MRI. It will not change the lease terms you have set up in your PMS system.</p>
