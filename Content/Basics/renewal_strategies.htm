        <p>There are many different renewal strategies. Two common strategies are resident retention and maximum revenue.</p>

        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="renewal strategies:resident retention" />Resident Retention Strategy</h2>
        <p class="less_space">Some key components of a resident retention strategy include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conservative Increases</li>
            <li>Minimize Turnover Costs and Vacancy Loss</li>
            <li>Incentives for Early Committal to Renew</li>
            <li>Rewards for Length of Tenancy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a good strategic approach when the economy/market has weakened, the cost of home ownership is comparable to renting in the area, or you're planning to refinance or sell the property.</p>
        <p>You're more likely to negotiate with residents when employing this strategy.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="renewal strategies:maximum revenue" />Maximum Revenue Strategy</h2>
        <p class="less_space">Some key components of a maximum revenue strategy include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More Aggressive Increases</li>
            <li>Focus on Rent/Revenue Growth</li>
            <li>Budget for Higher Turnover</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This strategy works well in markets where it is expensive to move, expensive to buy a home, or expensive to rent at another community. Although you may get more turnover with this strategy, this could be a good thing in the long run if new residents will pay considerably more than the existing residents.</p>
        <p>You may do some negotiating with this strategy, but you will still be focused on getting an increase for the unit.</p>
