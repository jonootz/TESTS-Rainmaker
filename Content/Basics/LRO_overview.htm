            <MadCap:keyword term="LRO:overview;overview: LRO" />LRO  Overview</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system is a powerful revenue management tool that will help ensure you are charging the right prices and offering the right lease terms to maximize your revenue.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> and Your Property Management System</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system utilizes information from your PMS system to generate recommended lease terms and pricing. This means that it is important that certain key information is regularly entered into your PMS&#160;system.</p>
        <p>Each night, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system extracts the data from your PMS system and uses it to generate pricing recommendations for the community. If the relationships between the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system and your PMS system is bidirectional, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system will extract the information it needs from the PMS system and then push the pricing recommendations back to the PMS system. This provides a convenient way for your on-site teams to get the pricing each day. </p>
        <h2>Key <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> Screens</h2>
        <p>There are some key screens you'll use in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system:</p>

        <h2>Pricing Calls</h2>
        <p>An important part of using the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system effectively is the weekly pricing call. The participants in these calls are typically the VP/Regional Manager, Community Manager, Leasing Team, Marketing, and Training. On each call, about 5 minutes is spent per community discussing pricing and goals for the community. Also, any concerns are discussed and any unusual circumstances that should be taken into account such as road construction projects that are going on near the community entrance.</p>
        <p>Pricing calls are initially facilitated by a Rainmaker Business Consultant. After a contractual period of time, these are taken over in-house or a Rainmaker employee will continue to lead the pricing call if you have paid for Pricing Services.</p>
