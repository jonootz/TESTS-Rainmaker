            <MadCap:keyword term="setting up:competitors;competitors:setting up;competitor setup;adding:competitors;competitors:adding" />Setting Up Competitors</h1>
        <p>Competitors are the communities in the area that your community competes with for traffic and leases. Ideally, you'll enter 4-6 competitors for your community. You will typically set up your competitors when you are initially setting up the community in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> system. Then you will enter competitor rents each week on the Comp Rents screen. You may need to periodically edit or delete competitors or add new ones, depending on what is happening in the area near your community.</p>
        <p>Competitors are set up under <span class="bold">LRO</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Competitors</span>&gt;<span class="bold">Comp Setup</span>. This is where you enter information about your competitors and map their floorplans to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> unit types.</p>
        <p class="note">After setting up your competitors, you'll need to enter competitor <a href="../Screens/comp_weights_screen.htm">weights</a> and <a href="../Screens/comp_positions_screen.htm">positions</a>.</p>

        <h3>Zooming on the Map</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>You can zoom in and out on the map to see fewer or more communities.</p>
            <p>If there are multiple communities in the same area, you may see an icon with a number which represents the number of communities in that area. If you click on the icon, it will zoom to that area to show you the communities.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/WebUI/add_comp_zoom_numbers.png" />
            </p>
            <p class="note">If you zoom out too far, the map will stop filtering and searching. You'll need to zoom in some if this happens.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Understanding the Properties Noted on the Map</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>The legend at the top of the map will help you keep track of the communities that are pinned.</p>
            <p class="note">You can click on the Auto Comp, Sister, or Manual pin in the legend to only display those communities on the map.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/WebUI/add_comp_map_legend.png" />
            </p>
            <div class="indent">
                <p>Red pin - This is your community. You can see where it is on the map in relation to other communities.</p>
                <p>Dark Blue Pin - These are the communities that  have at least one available floorplan and are eligible to use Automated Comps to get rents. When adding a new competitor, you would typically select one of these communities, whether you use Automated Comps or not.</p>
                <p>Light Blue Pin - These are sister communities. Sister communities are  other communities  that you have in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" />. If you choose one of these communities as a competitor, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.LRO" /> generated price will be used as the comp rent. You cannot use Automated Comps with sister communities.</p>
                <p>Blue Pin - These are the  competitors that have been entered manually for your community or another community. They are not set up to use Automated Comps.</p>
                <p>Green Pin (not in the legend) - These are the competitors that you have selected to add, but haven't added yet.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Available Floorplans</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>If you are using Automated Comps, when you click on an Auto Comp competitor pin (Dark Blue), you can see which floorplans are currently available at that property.<br /></p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/WebUI/add_auto_comp_popup.png" />

        </div>
        <h3>Reasons You May Not See A Competitor on the Map </h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p class="less_space">If a competitor does not appear on the map, it is not available to use Automated Comps and you will need to manually enter it. A competitor may not be available to use Automated Comps because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>quality rent information is not available for the property</li>
                <li>address information is wrong </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">Automated Comps is not available for properties in Canada.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Reasons You May See A Competitor on the Map Multiple Times</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <ul>
                <li>A competitor may appear on the map multiple times because the address is slightly different. For example, you may have the competitor manually entered with the address as 112 S. Main St., Automated Comps may have the address as 112 South Main Street, and another community may have the same competitor with an address of 112 Main Street, South. </li>
                <li>You may also see a competitor on the map multiple times if the same competitor has been saved manually for different communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are using Automated Comps, you should <a href="../AutoComp/transition_to_auto_comp.htm">transition your existing competitors to Automated Comps</a> before adding new ones. This way, you'll be less likely to see duplicates.</p>
            <p>When you are setting up a new competitor, if you see multiple instances of a competitor and aren't sure which one to choose, you should select the Automated Comps one, even if you aren't using Automated Comps.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Selecting Competitors to Add</h3>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>You can select the competitor or competitors that you want to add by selecting the name from the list or by clicking the pin on the map, then clicking Select. </p>
            <p>You can unselect a competitor by clicking on it in the list or by clicking the pin on the map, then clicking Deselect.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/WebUI/select_competitors.png" />

            <p class="note">If there is a long list of communities, you can use the Search box at the top of the list to find the one you want. This  searches through the communities that are listed.</p>
            <div class="no_break">
                <p>You can select the Selected Comps button to see a list of comps you have selected to quickly review them and unselect any of them, if necessary.</p>
